## AKA JS_Calc!!

### Breakdown: <br>
We both did our seperate work and we communicated through Slack and during classroom time.<br>
**Sarah** did the back-end of the Calculator, where she used Libraries in the Expression class to create the Calculator parsing. She also dealt with the errors and On-click methods by using boolean statements in order to prevent crashing. <br>
**Joshelyn** did the UI layout of the Calculator, meaning the front-end. She created a drawable inside the project to create xml files for different types of buttons and shapes. She also inserted a png image as the new icon for the JS_Calc. <br>

### Complications that We Faced With: <br>
For **Sarah**, the factorial was her biggest issue because factorials were not included in the library. It took about a whole day to understand how to get the factorial to work. Also, she faced with many crashes of the app since the item called was not there (ex: If I pressed 5 * and then press =, then the app crashes). It took her a while to add error messages to avoid the crashes. <br>
For **Joshelyn**, the issue was the thinking too beyond. In other words, she was thinking of implementing custom fonts and doing a launch image. Due to the press for time, she made her choice to give it up and to work on the buttons. Another complication was the POSITIONING!! It was easy to create Linear Layouts to each line, but within it, it caused imperfections while using different phones. But with the help of Sarah, they got it to make it work! It took her a while to learn that using the style.xml helped her implement the button texts much easier.
